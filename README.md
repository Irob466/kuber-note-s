various resources about kubernetes that i done picked up

## Tutorials

- [Kubernetes for Full Stack Developers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/curriculums/kubernetes-for-full-stack-developers)
- [Getting Started With Kubernetes + Containers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/meetup_kits/getting-started-with-containers-and-kubernetes-a-digitalocean-meetup-kit) - Assumes that you're using a cloud Kubernetes cluster from DigitalOcean, but you can do it locally.

  - Local requirements:
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
    - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    - [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
      - Not required if you are running on a DigitalOcean cluster.
      - Requires a hypervisor (install docs help with that).

- [Game of Pods](https://dev.to/kodekloud/learn-kubernetes-by-playing-the-game-of-pods-43g4)

## Tools

- [Play With K8s](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/) - A kubernetes playground ran by the folks at Docker.
